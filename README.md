# Teaching-program
A program written to help younger students to learn math basics, maybe multiple subjects and localisations would get added in the future.
This is intended to be a charity project that, once presentable/good enough, would be donated to charities who would be able to get the
program to students and schools who would need it.

To Do list:
1. Complete Basic Algebra .java file to be able to do multiple forms of basic algebra (DONE)
3. Creating a GUI for each type of problem (done by making a GUI that works for each type instead of making GUI for each problem)

for now this project can be considered complete (maybe I will make an android version later)
